<p>this is a young ma that likes to code and play video games all day in his room.
    pls dont judge him for putting this website online for people to see he is still learning how to code.
    it is only his third day doing this.</p>
    <h1>I bet this is the worst browser you have ever seen befor</h1>
    <p>To let anyone that wants to code know it is so fun you picked a good profession that you want to be
        also.for anyone thaat hasent considerd coding as something they want to do you should try it you might like it.</p>
